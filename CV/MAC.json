      "description": "I enjoy solving problems—kind of like the Wolf from Pulp Fiction. When something’s broken, I’m the guy who steps in, figures it out, and makes it work, no matter the challenge.\n\nI'm currently deciding whether to focus more on management or return to a more technical role. Over time, I've naturally taken on more leadership roles—building teams, defining the technical vision, and setting strategy—but I still enjoy getting hands-on with technical tasks.\n\nThe balance between leadership and technical work has changed over time. Some days it’s 40/60, other times 0/100 or 20/80, depending on the company’s needs, the team's needs and the product. I see it as a strength—different situations require different levels of involvement.\n\nI value flexibility, async communication, and remote work. I value results, not hours. Becoming a father has made these things even more important.\n\nI enjoy working with people who value Agile, DevOps, or XP and where I can keep learning.\n\nI've been into AI and remote work for years, even before they were popular. When it comes to AI, I’m ready to contribute in areas like management, operations, or a mix of both, helping drive strategy and impact.\n\nI’m a product-driven software engineer ⚡, with experience across the entire product lifecycle.\n\n✔ Generalist? Yes ☝—I handle everything from gathering requirements, brainstorming, and planning to architecture, coding, deployment, and monitoring. In short, the full product lifecycle.\n\n✔ Specialist? Also ✌—I have deep expertise in Frontend, but I’m also comfortable with Backend, Cloud infrastructure, and CI/CD pipelines to make sure everything works smoothly.",

They offer applications for **Confluence and Jira**, enhancing content creation, review, and publishing workflows for businesses. In 2022, Comalatech was acquired by Appfire, expanding their reach in the document management domain.\n\n💥 Key Responsibilities & Achievements 💥\n\n📄 Worked on **Comala Document Management (6,000+ installs on Atlassian Marketplace)**, contributing to **frontend and backend development** of cloud-based workflow automation tools.  \n\n🧪 Designed and implemented **End-to-End (E2E) and unit testing strategies** for Cloud products, ensuring that the most critical features and workflows were rigorously tested for reliability and stability in mission-critical enterprise tools. \n\n🐞 **Investigated, analyzed, and resolved complex bugs** in **Node.js, Express.js, AWS, React.js, Redux** applications, improving product reliability.  \n\n☁️ **Focused on Cloud-first challenges**, including Serverless architectures, distributed queues, and large-scale data migrations.  \n\n👟 Conducted **mentorship & training sessions**, introducing **TypeScript, refactoring best practices, and test automation**.  \n\n🗨️ Advocated for **async-first communication**, optimizing remote collaboration across Spain, Mexico, and Canada.\n\n💥 Why a Short Tenure?\n\nI expected to grow into a leadership role and improve my compensation over time, but my personal situation—buying a house, expecting my first child—demanded stability and immediate growth opportunities. While I valued the product-driven environment and user impact, The role had technical challenges, but I was used to a higher pace and complexity. Adjusting took time, and I sought more opportunities to push my limits.\n\n💥 Key Takeaway: Gained experience in product culture, remote work, serverless architectures (AWS), and user-facing development. Despite my short tenure, it was a valuable learning experience, and leaving was a difficult decision."

    "desiredJobDescription": "I enjoy solving problems—kind of like the Wolf from Pulp Fiction. When something’s broken, I’m the guy who steps in, figures it out, and makes it work, no matter the challenge.\n\nI'm currently deciding whether to focus more on management or return to a more technical role. Over time, I've naturally taken on more leadership roles—building teams, defining the technical vision, and setting strategy—but I still enjoy getting hands-on with technical tasks.\n\nThe balance between leadership and technical work has changed over time. Some days it’s 40/60, other times 0/100 or 20/80, depending on the company’s needs, the team's needs and the product. I see it as a strength—different situations require different levels of involvement.\n\nI value flexibility, async communication, and remote work. I value results, not hours. Becoming a father has made these things even more important.\n\nI enjoy working with people who value Agile, DevOps, or XP and where I can keep learning.\n\nI've been into AI and remote work for years, even before they were popular. When it comes to AI, I’m ready to contribute in areas like management, operations, or a mix of both, helping drive strategy and impact.\n\nI’m a product-driven software engineer ⚡, with experience across the entire product lifecycle.\n\n✔ Generalist? Yes ☝—I handle everything from gathering requirements, brainstorming, and planning to architecture, coding, deployment, and monitoring. In short, the full product lifecycle.\n\n✔ Specialist? Also ✌—I have deep expertise in Frontend, but I’m also comfortable with Backend, Cloud infrastructure, and CI/CD pipelines to make sure everything works smoothly.",
    "goodPractices": "I enjoy solving problems—kind of like Mr. Miyagi from Karate Kid. When something’s broken, I’m not here to overcomplicate things. I just give it a good \"dar cera, pulir cera\", get to work, and fix it.\n\nI don’t believe in hiding behind complexity or buzzwords. In my approach, simplicity always wins. It's not about the latest framework or the newest trend—it's about what works, what’s clear, and what gets results. Pragmatism is key, but the real kind, not the one you read about in LinkedIn posts. I focus on delivering value, not just ticking boxes.\n\nHere are some key principles I live by:\n\n📌 **Testing Strategy & TDD**: I’ve built testing strategies, frameworks, and adapted TDD to meet the team’s maturity and project needs. But it's not just about coding tests—it’s about building a culture where testing and quality are everyone’s responsibility. No shortcuts.\n\n🚀 **Engineering Leadership & Decision-Making**: I help teams make decisions that matter, balancing speed with long-term impact and always keeping the cost-to-value ratio in mind. It's about delivering features quickly, getting real user feedback early, and making sure the product keeps evolving based on that. Forget theory—let’s focus on what really works. I work with engineers on design patterns and clean code, but I prioritize progress over perfection. Iteration is key, and small, continuous steps get us closer to delivering real value.\n\n🔄 **Agile & Continuous Delivery**: I focus on fast iterations, baby steps that deliver value early and often. With each release, we gather feedback quickly from the users to steer the next iteration. This feedback loop allows us to adjust course quickly, making sure we stay aligned with what the customer really needs. It’s about testing and refining, not waiting for the “perfect” solution.\n\n🛠 **Simplicity as a Core Engineering Principle**: KISS and YAGNI aren’t just buzzwords for me—they’re the way I work. Solutions need to be lightweight, maintainable, and easy to evolve. I avoid overengineering both in code and in process, because we all know how that turns into a mess down the line. Keep it simple, keep it moving.\n\n⚡ **Refactoring & Technical Debt Management**: Whether it’s a greenfield or legacy codebase, I’ve led refactoring initiatives.. I’ve trained teams to identify and address technical debt—not because it's trendy, but because it’s essential for sustainable growth. We build systems that are practical, effective, and that can evolve without falling apart.\n\n🧩 **Contextual Leadership & Adaptability**: Leadership isn't a one-size-fits-all approach. Some engineers need mentoring, others need autonomy. I adjust based on the team and the situation, always aligning efforts with the product and business strategy. No one gets left behind, but we don’t waste time either.\n\nIn summary, I focus on results—real ones. I balance technical expertise with leadership, staying committed to simplicity as the foundation of everything I do. I build maintainable software, while ensuring that teams work efficiently, deliver value quickly, and always improve.",
